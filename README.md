# Overview

This suite contains a number of programs, which act as examples to understand
the usage of new OpenSHMEM features which are under discussion for being added
into the OpenSHMEM specification. The OpenSHMEM routines used in these example
programs are **SHMEMX_** prefixed, as they not yet part of OpenSHMEM standards. 

These routines are already implemented in Cray SHMEM. Cray SHMEM is the
OpenSHMEM implementation from Cray Inc. Labels in the programs, provide further 
details on the version from which these routines are supported in the Cray SHMEM 
implementation.
